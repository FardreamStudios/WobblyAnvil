battle bugs
1. select box is offset from characters, no select sound, clicking/tapping away from any target should deselect. select should be removed on action cam.
2. crossed swords icon shows up at end of fight. this is not needed at all.
3. action cam buttons need to be bottom right similar in position to the formation menu buttons. these should be pretty much identical in area to each other.
4. item/skill menus are semi transparent they should be solid
5. cannot dodge, new action cam setup may have the "chalkboard not in the action cam screen area.

## 🔲 Battle System — Remaining V1

### Engagement System Rework (see `EngagementSystemSpec.md`)
- Replace ATB tick loop with initiative roll + fixed turn order
- Replace pip tracking with AP pools (earn per turn, carry over, cap)
- Replace exchange flow (swap sides, RELENT, PASS) with one-trade model + optional counter
- Remove in-cam item/defend buttons (formation-only now)
- Replace ATB gauge strip UI with turn order strip
- Replace pip display in info panels with AP bar
- Update formation action menu for new action list (immediate skill, delayed skill, item, defend, flee, wait)
- Adapt enemy auto-swing to initiative-driven turns

### CombatFeel Step 7 (see `CombatFeelSpec.md`)
- Wire Chalkboard.js into QTERunner.js
- Update BattleView.js phase flow (CAM_SWING_QTE → CAM_SWING_PLAYBACK)

### Other V1
- Loot drops from enemies (loot tables exist in spec, not wired)
- INTRO phase
- Enemy variety (3–4 types specced, currently 2 wired + wave 2 test data)
- Battle music integration
- Player skill choice (currently always `skills[0]`)

## 🎯 Next Priority — "Find the Fun" Polish

- **Ring QTE intuitiveness** — shrinking circle mechanic may need UX rework for mobile (clearer hit zone, better timing feedback, "tap here" indicator, or rethink interaction model)
- **AP tuning** — earn rates per speed tier, skill costs, counter cost. "Eat the hit vs counter" needs to feel like a real choice
- **Initiative feel** — turn order strip readability, speed variance range, does the fixed sequence feel fair or frustrating?
- **One-trade cam pacing** — does a single exchange feel satisfying or too short? Counter decision timing
- **Juice** — hit feel, screen shake tuning, SFX variety, damage number polish

## 🐛 Known Bugs

- **Music transition on battle enter/exit** — `useAmbientAudio` hook doesn't cleanly hand off. Related: `sfx.setMode("forge")` pattern in `useForgeVM`.
- **Desktop has no swipe input** — click = tap only. Mobile emulation in DevTools works. May want keyboard shortcut as swipe stand-in.

## 🧹 Cleanup / Tech Debt

- `devSkipPersist` removal — blocked on tutorial verification
- Debug `console.log`s in `forgeTutorial.js` — keep until forge tutorial build complete
- ESLint backlog: `no-mixed-operators` (18), `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` (40), misc (5)
- `BattleCharacter.js` uses module export pattern (`.BattleCharacter`, `.DamageNumber`) — all other extracted components use default exports
- Extracted component CSS still lives in `BattleView.css` — optional split later
- `AnimInstance` audio cleanup — `new Audio()` should wire through main audio system

## 🔮 Horizon (V2+)

### Battle
- `battleMode.js` state machine (sub-mode contract: `canEnter`, `onEnter`, `onExit`)
- Delayed skills + combo triggers (see `EngagementSystemSpec.md` §6)
- Intercept & Taunt protection skills (see `EngagementSystemSpec.md` §7)
- Boss waves
- Fairy commentary via observer
- Fairy as party member (`aiControlled` + `onActionNeeded` callback)
- Enemy AI personality — AP spending behavior (saving, baiting, aggression profiles)

### QTE
- DES-2 QTE plugin system — decoupled `QTERunner` with plugin contract
- QTE pause/resume for fairy tutorial moments
- Per-ring visual config expansion (custom colors, icons per beat)

### Fairy
- Fairy chat system testing on mobile (live Cloudflare Worker)
- Desktop fairy system testing (reactive + tutorial)
- `noPoof` flag on playCue
- Intent registry in handleCommand
- `data-*` pass-through on widgets
- Sticky/pinned mode
- Generic NPC controller base

### Game Modes
- Simulator vs Adventure mode split (see `GameModeArchitecture.md`)
- Equipment system (Adventure mode)
- Zone / encounter definitions
